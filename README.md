# Palindromes

Challenge issued by **@baileyn**.

Create a function that can be used to determine if a word/phrase is a palindrome or not (spelled the same forward and backwards). Generally, with functions like this, you'd ignore punctuation, spaces, and capitalization. Although, anything is some practice! 

A couple of test cases to assure your function works correctly:
* Single words: "radar", "racecar", "madam"
* Phrases with spaces: "nurses run", "step on no pets", "top spot"
* Phrases with punctuation and spaces: "Don't nod", "I did, did I?", "Red rum, sir, is murder"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installing

Run the makefile in the project directory using the command

```
make
```

An executable named palindrome.exe will be compiled in the project folder.
